# Car Price Prediction 🚗

This project is a **Car Price Prediction** model developed during my internship at **Oasis Infobyte**. The goal of this project is to predict the price of a car based on various features using machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Features

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature selection and engineering
* Model building and training (using regression algorithms)
* Model evaluation and prediction

## 📁 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
* Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [(https://github.com/Priyam2xx3/OIBSIP_CAR)]
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

4. Run all cells to see the complete workflow.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used contains details like car model, year, fuel type, seller type, transmission, kilometers driven, and more.
*(You can mention the dataset source here, e.g., Kaggle link if applicable)*

## ✅ Results

The model predicts car prices with reasonable accuracy and can be further improved with hyperparameter tuning and more data.
